89,Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls in that they deny (the revelation) which God has sent down in insolent envy that God of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases; thus have they drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath. And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith.,Rest_verses
90,When it is said to them: Obelieve in what God hath sent down” they say OWe believe in what was sent down to us”; yet they reject all besides even if it be truth confirming what is with them. Say: OWhy then have ye slain the prophets of God in times gone by if ye did indeed believe?”,Rest_verses
91,There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the Calf (even) after that and ye did behave wrongfully.,Rest_verses
92,And remember We took your Covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai) (saying): OHold firmly to what We have given you and hearken (to the Law)”; they said: OWe hear and we disobey”; and they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their faithlessness.

93,Say: OIf the last Home with God be for you specially and not for anyone else then seek ye for death if ye are sincere.”,Rest_verses

101,They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of Solomon; the blasphemers were not Solomon but the evil ones teaching men magic and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (such things) without saying: OWe are only for trial so do not blaspheme.” They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by God’s permission. And they learned what harmed them not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls if they but knew!,Rest_verses
102,If they had kept their faith and guarded themselves from evil far better had been the reward from their Lord if they but knew!,Rest_verses

105,None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten but We substitute something better or similar; knowest thou not that God hath power over all things?,Rest_verses
106,Knowest thou not that to God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And besides Him ye have neither patron nor helper.,Rest_verses
107, Would ye question your Apostle as Moses was questioned of old? But whoever changeth from faith to unbelief hath strayed without doubt from the even way.,Rest_verses
108,Quite a number of the people of the Book wish they could turn you (people) back to infidelity after ye have believed from selfish envy after the truth hath become manifest unto them; but forgive and overlook till God accomplish His purpose; for God hath power over all things.,Rest_verses
109,And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: and whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you ye shall find it with God; for God sees well all that ye do.,Rest_verses
110,And they say: ONone shall enter paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.” Those are their (vain) desires. Say: OProduce your proof if ye are truthful.”,Rest_verses
111,Nay whoever submits his whole self to God and is a doer of good he will get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.,Rest_verses
112,The Jews say: OThe Christians have naught (to stand) upon”; and the Christians say: OThe Jews have naught (to stand) upon.” Yet they (profess to) study the (same) Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not but God will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment.,Rest_verses
113,And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of God God’s name should be celebrated? Whose zeal is (in fact) to ruin them?

117,Say those without knowledge: OWhy speaketh not God unto Us? Or why cometh not unto Us a sign?” So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the signs unto any people who hold firmly to faith (in their hearts).,Rest_verses
118,Verily We have sent thee in truth as a bearer of glad tidings and a warner. But of thee no question shall be asked of Companions of the blazing fire.,Rest_verses
119,Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion.

125,And remember Abraham said: OMy Lord make this a City of Peace and feed its people with fruits such of them as believe in God and the Last Day.” He said: O(Yea) and such as reject faith for a while will I grant them their pleasure but will soon drive them to the torment of fire an evil destination (indeed)!”,Rest_verses

128,OOur Lord! send amongst them an Apostle of their own who shall rehearse Thy Signs to them and instruct them in Scripture and Wisdom and sanctify them; for Thou art the Exalted in Might the Wise.”,Rest_verses

130,Behold! his Lord said to him: OBow (thy will to me)” He said: OI bow (my will) to the Lord and Cherisher of the universe.”,Rest_verses

134,They say: OBecome Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (to salvation).” Say thou: ONay! (I would rather) the religion of Abraham the true and he joined not gods with God.”,Rest_verses
135,Say ye: OWe believe in God and the revelation given to us and to Abraham Isma`il Isaac Jacob and the Tribes and that given to Moses and Jesus and that given to (all) Prophets from their Lord we make no difference between one and another of them and we bow to God (in Islam).”,Rest_verses
136,So if they believe as ye believe they are indeed on the right path; but if they turn back it is they who are in schism; but God will suffice thee as against them and He is the All-Hearing the All- Knowing.,Rest_verses
137,(Our religion is) the baptism of God; and who can baptize better than God? and it is He whom we worship.,Rest_verses
138,Say: Will ye dispute with us about God seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and ye for yours; and that we are sincere (in our faith) in Him?,Rest_verses

Indeed it was (a change) momentous except to those guided by God. And never would God make your faith of no effect. For God is to all people most surely full of kindness Most Merciful.,Rest_verses
143,We see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the heavens; now shall We turn thee to a Qiblah that shall please thee.

The people of the book know well that that is the truth from their Lord nor is God unmindful of what they do.,Rest_verses
144,Even if thou wert to bring to the people of the Book all the signs (together) they would not follow thy Qiblah; nor art thou going to follow their Qiblah; nor indeed will they follow each other’s Qiblah.

Whatever good ye give, shall be rendered back to you and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly.",Rest_verses
272, (Charity is) for those in need who in God’s cause are restricted (from travel) and cannot move about in the land seeking (for trade or work). The ignorant man thinks because of their modesty that they are free from want. Thou shalt know them by their (unfailing) mark: they beg not importunately from all and sundry. And whatever of good ye give be assured God knoweth it well.,Rest_verses

That is because they say: OTrade is like usury but God hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord desist shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for God (to judge); but those who repeat (the offence) are companions of the fire: they will abide therein (for ever).,Rest_verses

281,O ye who believe! when ye deal with each other in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period of time reduce them to writing. Let a scribe write down faithfully as between the parties: let not the scribe refuse to write as God has taught him so let him write. Let him who incurs the liability dictate but let him fear his Lord God and not diminish aught of what he owes. If the party liable is mentally deficient or weak or unable himself to dictate let his guardian dictate faithfully. And get two witnesses out of your own men and if there are not two men then a man and two women such as ye choose for witnesses so that if one of them errs the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called on (for evidence). Disdain not to reduce to writing (your contract) for a future period whether it be small or big: it is juster in the sight of God more suitable as evidence and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves; but if it be a transaction which ye carry out on the spot among yourselves there is no blame on you if ye reduce it not to writing. But take witnesses whenever ye make a commercial contract; and let neither scribe nor witness suffer harm. If ye do (such harm) it would be wickedness in you. So fear God; for it is God that teaches you. And God is well acquainted with all things.,Pilgrimage
282,If ye are on a journey and cannot find a scribe a pledge with possession (may serve the purpose). And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another let the trustee (faithfully) discharge his trust and let him fear his Lord. Conceal not evidence; for whoever conceals it his heart is tainted with sin. And God knoweth all that ye do.,Rest_verses
283,To God belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth. Whether ye show what is in your minds or conceal it God calleth you to account for it. He forgiveth whom He pleaseth and punisheth whom He pleaseth. For God hath power over all things.,Rest_verses
284,The Apostle believeth in what hath been revealed to him from his Lord as do the men of faith. Each one (of them) believeth in God His angels His books and His Apostles OWe make no distinction (they say) between one and another of His Apostles.” And they say: OWe hear and we obey; (We seek) Thy forgiveness Our Lord and to Thee is the end of all journeys.”,Rest_verses
285,On no soul doth God place a burden greater than it can bear. It gets every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. (Pray): OOur Lord! condemn us not if we forget or fall into error; our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which Thou didst lay on those before us; Our Lord! lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector; help us against those who stand against faith.”,Rest_verses
